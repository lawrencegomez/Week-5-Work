## Poor Ol' Uncle Derry

Uncle Derry loves him some fishin. You however, do not. In fact, even 
Uncle Derry is just plain annoying.

Nevertheless, Uncle Derry heard from Aunt Dawn who heard from Grammy 
Penny who heard from Peepaw Wilson that you were a big time web 
developer. And now, poor ol' Uncle Derry needs help on his desperate 
fishing website's homepage.

You feel bad for your uncle, but your time is short as a billionaire 
web-developer. You decide to help, but put in the minimal effort with
a CSS/JS Framework called Bootstrap.

#### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a CSS/JS Framework. It makes styling a breeze!

Bootstrap easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications 
with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS
media queries.

With Bootstrap, you get extensive and beautiful documentation for 
common HTML elements, dozens of custom HTML and CSS components, and 
awesome jQuery plugins.

Bootstrap ships with vanilla CSS, but its source code utilizes the two 
most popular CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. Quickly get started 
with precompiled CSS or build on the source.


## Installing Bootstrap

I've added a markdown for [How to Add Twitter Bootstrap to Your Rails App](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_SM_21/blob/master/resources/cheatsheets/bootstrap_cheatsheet.md)
to Github and included it in `WDI_SM_21/resources/cheatsheets` (in
your repos).

But for this lesson, we'll just be using a good ol' CDN.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

Include these in your head tag.

## Bootstrap Goodies

Bootstrap comes with quite a bit. Too much to cover in one lesson in
fact, but lets look at the most essential features of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

#### Break into Groups!

1. Navbars & Masthead/Jumbotron/Buttons/Container
2. Grid System & Tables
3. Modals & Carousels 
4. Input Groups & Panels


Each group should take __20 minutes__ to research their topic, and be able 
to present it to the class with a small amount of sample code to 
demonstrate what they've learned. 

### __*Your sample code should be about fishing.*__

Remember: we're here to help Uncle Derry.

## Fix Up Uncle Derry's Site

Take 20 minutes to use what you've learned in bootstrap to fix up 
Uncle Derry's Site. Try and use __NO custom CSS__ when styling his 
site! Make sure it looks something like this when you're done:

__navbar__:

![derry_nav](page_design/derry_navbar.png)

<br>

__overall page__:

![derry_page](page_design/derry_page.png)

## Conclusion

Uncle Derry is thrilled at your styling (or as thrilled as Uncle Derry
can be). Let's see what we've learned.

1. What is a CSS Framework?
2. How does Bootstrap help us optimize our websites for different 
   screen sizes?
3. Why would a developer bother to use a CSS Framework's grid system?
